# Random_Forest_Classification
Random forest is a flexible, easy to use machine learning algorithm that produces, even without hyper-parameter tuning, a great result most of the time. It is also one of the most used algorithms, because of its simplicity and diversity (it can be used for both classification and regression tasks). In this post we'll learn how the random forest algorithm works, how it differs from other algorithms and how to use it.

## How Random Forest Works
Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm. The "forest" it builds, is an ensemble of decision trees, usually trained with the “bagging” method. The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning models increases the overall result.

One big advantage of random forest is that it can be used for both classification and regression problems, which form the majority of current machine learning systems. Let's look at random forest in classification, since classification is sometimes considered the building block of machine learning.

Random forest has nearly the same hyperparameters as a decision tree or a bagging classifier. Fortunately, there's no need to combine a decision tree with a bagging classifier because you can easily use the classifier-class of random forest. With random forest, you can also deal with regression tasks by using the algorithm's regressor.

Random forest adds additional randomness to the model, while growing the trees. Instead of searching for the most important feature while splitting a node, it searches for the best feature among a random subset of features. This results in a wide diversity that generally results in a better model.

Therefore, in random forest, only a random subset of the features is taken into consideration by the algorithm for splitting a node. You can even make trees more random by additionally using random thresholds for each feature rather than searching for the best possible thresholds (like a normal decision tree does).
